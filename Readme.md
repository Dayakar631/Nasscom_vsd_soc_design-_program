## Introduction to QFN-48 Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs
Arduino Board:- This is an arduino microcontroller board. The encircled area shows the chip(microprocessor) which is interfaced with other components of the board. The designing of this chip from abstract level all the way down to the fabrication is done by RTL to GDSll flow.Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

chip components
(1) Pads: Through which we can send the signal inside the chip.
(2) Core: Place where all the logic gates are fixed.
(3) Die: Present at the corner. it is the size of the entire chip.
EX. RISC-V SoC:- It consist of SRAM,SOC,ADC,DAC,SPI these all are called foundary IP's.All devices depends upon foundary where all chips are fabricated using deposition and lithography techniques and so on.
